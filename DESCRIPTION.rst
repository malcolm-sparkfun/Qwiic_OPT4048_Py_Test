=============================================

Adds functionality for the Qwiic OPT4048 Tristiumulus Color Sensor.
The OPT4048 is a high-performance, low-power color sensor that can 
be used to detect the color of an object. The sensor has a 12-bit ADC 
that can be used to measure the color of an object and output the data 
in the form of XYZ or RGB. The sensor also has a built-in IR filter to 
help reduce the influence of IR light on the color measurement.
